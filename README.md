## Legislation
* **Arizona** - [Executive order 2015-09](http://azgovernor.gov/file/2660/download?token=nLkPLRi1) was signed to direct all state agencies to *undertake any necessary steps to support the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles on public roads within Arizona*. The executive order also specifies that in Arizona the operator of a self-driving vehicle does *not* have to be physically inside the vehicle. The vehicle can be directed remotely in self-driving mode.
* **Colorado** - Colorado [passes first law](http://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/01/colorado-law-regulate-driverless-vehicles/) to regulate self-driving cars. Companies who plan to test self-driving cars in Colorado need to first check in with the state Department of Transportation and State Patrol.
* [**California**](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/bkgd) - Application required for [testing self-driving cars](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/testing). Manufacturers are required to provide [accident reports](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/autonomousveh_ol316+) and [disengagement reports](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/disengagement_report_2016). The regulations for [post-testing deployment](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/auto) of self-driving cars have been drafted and will establish the requirements for manufacturers to meet prior to operation on California’s on public roads.
* **New York** - It is [announced](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-autonomous-vehicle-testing-begin-new-york-state) on May 10, 2017 that the state is accepting application for self-driving car testing. The pilot testing program is included in FY 2018 and can be further extended.
* **Texas** - Bill [SB 2205](http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/Search/DocViewer.aspx?ID=85RSB022051A&QueryText=%22SB+2205%22&DocType=A) is proposed to implement minimum safety requirements and accelerate testing of self-driving cars on public roads. The bill passed the Texas Senate Transportation Committee and it is currently pending Senate debate and referral to the House.
* **Virginia** - Arguably the most friendly state to self-driving cars with no application or permit required and [$25M per year fund](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/virginia-wants-to-steal-some-of-californias-driverless-thunder/2017/04/23/a4bc6b54-206c-11e7-a0a7-8b2a45e3dc84_story.html?utm_term=.cfaac3ec962d) set to facilitate self-driving cars. [Virginia Automated Corridors](https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=8526) is announced to offer self-driving car developers the opportunity to *test their technologies on Virginia roads covering more than 70 miles of interstates and arterials in the Northern Virginia region*.
